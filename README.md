# YASIRLANA
YASIRLANA is a system designed to assist medical personnel, particularly at RSGM YARSI, in conducting Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The system uses 3 public publication database APIs, IEEE, Semantic Scholar, and Europe Pubmed Central, to search for articles and journals relevant to the keyword entered by the user. After collecting relevant articles and journals, the system uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to predict which articles or journals fall under the include or exclude a category.

### Background:
In 2021, Pubmed published over 38,800 articles specifically related to Dentistry. Every year, the number of published research will continue to increase. This leads to the need for a longer time and more effort for specialists, particularly doctors, to conduct the screening article stage in a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The results of this article's screening process are used by doctors to obtain or compare information about test methods, treatments, or prevention of disease (Przybyła et al., 2018). According to (Clark et al., 2021), someone can spend 3 to 4 hours on manual screening of a single article. Meanwhile, according to (Przybyła et al., 2018), it is estimated that the manual screening of 5000 articles would take 126 hours or about 5 and a half days. On the other hand, using automation screening only takes 12 hours. The amount of time required for manual article screening can certainly hinder a doctor, as a doctor has limited time and energy in their work. Conducting an Automatic Systematic Literature Review can be a solution to help speed up a doctor in the article screening stage of the SLR.

## About This Project:
This research is a collaboration between the Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) and the Faculty of Information Technology (FTI) at Universitas YARSI in the field of e-health informatics research. The research involves students from both faculties and is part of the campus-independent research scheme. The research has also received a warm response and support from research partners at the School of Dentistry, University of Illinois at Chicago and YARSI Dental and Oral Hospital (RSGM YARSI).

The main output of this research is articles in reputable international journals. We will also write a textbook based on the research results, which will serve as a reference and enrich e-health informatics courses, especially in FKG and FTI YARSI. The built teledentistry prototype system will also be submitted as Intellectual Property.
